# This file provides a minimal, annotated metadata file in the M3 Houndstooth
# format recognized by Comet. It is intended to serve as an example for both
# reference (when writing institution‐specific metadata files) and demoing.
#
# See </docs/themanual/surfliner_schema/houndstooth.md> for more extensive
# documentation on the Houndstooth format and what is supported in the
# surfliner_schema gem.
#
# Features of M3 which are not currently supported by Comet are commented out.
#
# ______________________________________________________________________________

# M3 VERSION
# ==============================================================================
#
# The first thing in the file should be an `m3_version` property, with a value
# of `"1.0.beta1"`. This notifies Comet that the file is an M3 file.
m3_version: 1.0.beta1

# PROFILE METADATA
# ==============================================================================
#
# M3 provides some properties for specifying administrative metametadata
# regarding the schema, but Comet does not currently recognize or use this
# information.

#   responsibility: "https://surfliner.ucsd.edu"

# SCHEMA DEFINITION
# ==============================================================================
#
# All of the remaining top‐level properties define the schema, and can have one
# of two forms :—
#
# 1. An “object” form (key‐value pairs), in which the `name` property is implied
#    by the key. For example:
#
#        classes:
#          my_class:
#            display_label: My Class
#
# 2. An “array” form (list of items), in which case the `name` property must be
#    explicitly provided. For example:
#
#        classes:
#          - name: my_class
#            display_label: My Class
#
# The latter form is **recommended**; the former is for backwards‐compatibility
# with the original Samvera Houndstooth.

# Mapping Definitions
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The `name` of the mapping is the internal identifier by which the mapping will
# be referenced _in this file_. It doesn’t have any bearing on how properties
# are mapped in Comet or Superskunk.
#
# In order to be meaningful, mappings need to also have an `iri` property which
# corresponds to a recognized profile. We’ve been using Tag URIs which begin
# with the string `tag:surfliner.gitlab.io,2022:api/` for this. Mapping IRIs are
# **not** the same as property namespaces; for example we might have multiple
# different mappings to Dublin Core, depending on the application, so defining
# a mapping with an IRI of `http://purl.org/dc/terms/` would generally not be
# appropriate. Instead we use `tag:surfliner.gitlab.io,2022:api/oai_dc` (for
# example) to define the Dublin Core mapping which specifically targets OAI‐PMH
# feeds.
#
# Mappings without `iri` properties will just be ignored by Comet. We’ve
# tentatively set aside a `display_label` property, but it’s ignored as we don’t
# display these mappings anywhere in Comet right now.
mappings:
  - name: oai_dc
    # display_label: OAI‐PMH Dublin Core
    iri: tag:surfliner.gitlab.io,2022:api/oai_dc
  - name: ogm_aardvark
    # display_label: Open GeoMetadata Aardvark
    iri: tag:surfliner.gitlab.io,2022:api/aardvark

# Class Definitions
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Classes are conceptual categories of resource; each resource can belong to
# only one class. The class a resource is in determines its available
# properties. Every class needs to be defined in order to be used.
#
# I say “resource” and not “object” because I think the intention is that
# classes may eventually be used for things which are not objects (collections,
# file sets, files…?); however, at the moment all classes are converted to
# objects and classes with names like “collection” will simply be ignored.
#
# The `name` of the class is used to reference it within this file, _and also_
# is transformed to determine the name of the corresponding Ruby class used to
# model the object in Comet. Our present convention has been to name classes
# using `snake_case`.
#
# A `display_label` property on classes has been set aside, but it isn’t used
# right now.
#
# Samvera Hyrax also supports a `schema_uri` property which is used to associate
# the class with a given ontology, but we have no current plans to support this.
classes:
  - name: generic_object
    # display_label: "Generic Object"
  - name: geospatial_object
    # display_label: "Geospatial Object"

# Section Definitions
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Sections are used to group related properties in the user interface, to make
# metadata easier to view and/or edit. Sections are referenced by their `name`
# and need to be declared in order to be used.
#
# Sections are not class‐specific, but only sections which have properties will
# be rendered. A property can only belong to at most one section.
#
# The `display_label` is used to render the section title.
sections:
  - name: titling
    display_label: Title‐related Metadata
  - name: agents
    display_label: Agents & Associated Roles
  - name: dates
    display_label: Dates
  - name: identifiers
    display_label: Identifers
  - name: notes
    display_label: Notes

# Grouping Definitions
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Groupings are like sections: They group together related properties in the
# user interface, to make editing easier. However, while sections list each
# property individually, groupings only display as a single field with a
# dropdown for selecting the specific desired property. This is useful when
# there are a large number of closely‐related properties and only a small number
# may actually be relevant.
#
# In addition to a `display_label`, groupings **may** (but are not required to)
# have a `definition` and `usage_guidelines` for describing the entire property
# grouping.
#
# Groupings are not currently implemented in Comet, so these definitions are
# speculative for now.
#
# groupings:
#   - name: identifier
#     display_label: Identifier
#     definition: Identifiers used to identify the object.
#     usage_guidelines: |-
#       See the individual identifier properties for information on usage.

# Property Definitions
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Property definitions identify the metadata properties which are available on
# various classes. Property `name`s **must** be unique within a class, but two
# different classes can have different properties with the same `name`.
#
# The `title` property is hardcoded into Comet and (for now) you **should not**
# define it separately. Properties appear within sections and groupings in the
# order in which they are declared.
#
# Not all properties of properties (ugh) which have been defined in Houndstooth
# are currently supported in Comet; we only support the ones which are not
# commented below. `cardinality` is technically supported but has no practical
# effect.
#
# Only four practical values for `cardinality` are allowed :—
#
# - `{ minimum: 1, maximum: null }` (one or more)
# - `{ minimum: 1, maximum: 1 }` (exactly one)
# - `{ minimum: 0, maximum: 1 }` (zero or one)
# - `{ minimum: 0, maximum: null }` (zero or more)
#
# You **can** specify cardinalities other than these, but they will be coerced
# into one of the above values.
#
# Properties can be “extended” via a special YAML syntax: first, the base
# property must be given an identifier (beginning with `&`); then, the derived
# property must include the base property via a YAML reference (using the
# magical `<<` key). Here is what that looks like in practice :—
#
#     properties:
#       - &base_property
#         name: my_property
#         display_label: My Property
#         available_on:
#           - generic_object
#
#       - &derived_property
#         <<: *base_property
#         available_on:
#           - geospatial_object
#
# Some notes on doing this correctly :—
#
# - Anything you define in the derived property will override the values in the
#   base property. This _includes_ setting things to `null` or the empty string.
#   Omit (or comment out) anything you want to be inherited!
#
# - You **must** override `available_on` to specify a new availability for the
#   property. Availabilities **must not** be shared between the base and derived
#   properties.
#
# - Typically you will want to keep the `name` the same between the base and
#   derived property (do not override this).
#
# - It is only required to specify an `&identifier` for properties which you are
#   actually going to reference in a derived property, but for consistency and
#   ease of maintenance we have been specifying them for all properties.
