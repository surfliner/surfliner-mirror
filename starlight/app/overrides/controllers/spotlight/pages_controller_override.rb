# There appears to be a bug in the CanCan setup of `@pages` which does not
# properly route permissions through the exhibitâ€”exhibit featured pages show up
# for superadmins, but not ordinatry exhibit admins. This override circumvents
# CanCan behaviour to just list *all* the (published) pages in an exhibit
# regardless of access permissions. NOTE: This still requires permissions to
# view the exhibit to access.
#
# Ideally we would not need to circumvent CanCan here, but nobody is aware of a
# fix as far as we know.
