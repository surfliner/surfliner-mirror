# Deploying Starlight

## Environment Variables

Starlight aims at following the [12 factor application][12-factor] pattern as much as
possible. To that end, there are a set of environment variables that one should
populate when deploying to a staging/production server. Development and test
instances have sane defaults that you should not need to adjust unless you want
to.

How you make these environment variables available during deployment and
application runtime is up to you. You could use an Ansible playbook, Chef,
Puppet, or whatever works best in your local environment and practices.
