     #From skos:Primer "note on skos:exactMatch vs. owl:sameAs: SKOS provides skos:exactMatch to map concepts with equivalent meaning, and intentionally does not use owl:sameAs from the OWL ontology language [OWL]. When two resources are linked with owl:sameAs they are considered to be the same resource, and triples involving these resources are merged. This does not fit what is needed in most SKOS applications. In the above example, ex1:animal is said to be equivalent to ex2:animals. If this equivalence relation were represented using owl:sameAs, the following statements would hold for ex:animal"
