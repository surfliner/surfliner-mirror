## About
Project Surfliner is an experimental project of the UC San Diego and UC Santa Barbara libraries to collaboratively define, create, and maintain digital library products. Project Surfliner is more than shared code, or even shared objectives. The project is the collaboration effort. It is building and leveraging the strengths, experiences, and resources of each campus partner to focus on shared concepts and products. 
The collaboration is named Project Surfliner after the Amtrak route that links our institutions together.

## Products
The Project Surfliner team is collaboratively developing a number of products whose code all lives within this surfliner monorepo. All the products are also named after historic intra-California train routes.

### Lark
Lark is a shared authority control platform and API. See the [Lark README](https://gitlab.com/surfliner/surfliner/blob/master/lark/README.md) for more information. Lark was named after the Southern Pacific Lark Train that operated overnight between Los Angeles and San Francisco via San Luis Obispo from 1941 - April 1968.

### Starlight
Starlight is an exhibits platform based on [Spotlight](https://github.com/projectblacklight/spotlight). See the [Starlight README](https://gitlab.com/surfliner/surfliner/blob/master/starlight/README.md) for more information. Starlight was named after Southern Pacific Starlight Train that operated overnight between Los Angeles and San Francisco from October 1949 - July 1957.
