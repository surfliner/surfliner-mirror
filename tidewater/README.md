## Development Environment

You will need Docker and Docker Compose installed on your host/local system.

To setup a development environment:
1. `docker-compose build` to build images (`docker-compose up --build` does not work)
1. `docker-compose up`  to run dev environment
1. Access the application on http://localhost:3000

See the `docker-compose` [CLI reference][cli-reference][ for more on commands.
